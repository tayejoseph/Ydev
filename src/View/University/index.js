            The workplace future have shifted. Despite this, many students
            graduate without the relevant in-demand skills required in today's
            world. This is heartbreaking, and it affects us all greatly! That is
            why we are on a mission to change that by offering accelerator
            programs in partnership with universities that prepare the next
            generation to succeed in the digital economy.
